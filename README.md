UpColours-Segmentation-project

UpColours, an art company, decided to create different initiatives to improve their revenue. Their current strategy is analyzing customer behavior by building a descriptive model to improve the marketing campaigns efficiency. Hence, to create a reliable segmentation, the data was initially explored, pre-processed and transformed to then cluster the customers by similarities and campaign acceptance using segmentation techniques such as K-Means, SOM, DBSCAN and Hierarchical clustering.

The product usage segmentation customers were divided by highest, lowest, and medium-high amount spent. 
For customer value segmentation, two clusters stood out: one with higher incomes, amounts spent, and older; the second with a higher number of children. Also, further findings suggest that the lower the number of children, the higher the income and total amount spent. 
Regarding the purchasing channel used, one had less purchases through all the channels, another had the highest number of purchases through the store and the higher number of purchases with discounts, and the last one had the highest number of purchases on catalog. 

Thus, the clusters revelead to be very effective since it allowed to group the customers into three main groups. Group X, the frequent buyers, that could be targeted with premium offers, Group Z, the ones that could spend more and have the income to do it, that may be targeted through email marketing, and finally, Group Y, with more financial limitations, could be offered discounts.
